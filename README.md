# Array_and_ArrayList

This repository contains a Java program that addresses three different tasks. Please find details about each task below:

## Task 1: Arrays and Input Handling

The main class, `Main`, includes a program that declares two arrays named 'even' and 'odd'. It accepts numbers from the user and moves them to their respective arrays based on whether they are even or odd. The user is prompted to input the number of elements, and then the program takes the input numbers and categorizes them into even and odd arrays.

### Usage:

1. Run the `Main` class.
2. Enter the number of elements when prompted.
3. Input the numbers in a single line, separated by a space.

## Task 2: Nearest Neighbors in an Array

The `Main` class also implements a Java function that finds two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance between them. The function returns the index of the first number.

### Usage:

1. Ensure the `Main` class is compiled and run.
2. Follow the steps mentioned in Task 1 for input.
3. The program will output the two neighboring numbers with the smallest distance and their respective indices.

## Task 3: Array to ArrayList and Vice Versa

The Java program converts an array into an ArrayList and vice versa using the `ArrayList` class. It demonstrates the process of converting an array to an ArrayList and then converting the ArrayList back to an array.

### Usage:

1. Ensure the `Main` class is compiled and run.
2. Follow the steps mentioned in Task 1 for input.
3. The program will output the original array, converted ArrayList, and the array converted back from the ArrayList.
